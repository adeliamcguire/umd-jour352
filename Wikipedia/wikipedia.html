        <h2><b>Golden Doodles</b></h2>

    <p>The Goldendoodle, also known as a Groodle, is a designer dog created by crossbreeding a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. 
    First widely bred in the 1990s, they are bred in three different sizes—each corresponding to the size of Poodle used as a parent.
    Goldendoodles often demonstrate Golden Retrievers' intuitive and human-oriented nature in addition to the intelligent personality 
    and "allergy-friendly" coat of a Poodle.</p>

   <h2 class="header"><b>History</b></h2>
   <p>In the 1990s designer dog breeders in Australia and the United States (Ryan Harvey) started to widely cross Golden Retrievers and Poodles,
     adopting the term Goldendoodle to describe the cross.The name Doodle is also used to describe this breed. 
     The name Goldendoodle is derived from "Golden" (from Golden Retriever) and "Labradoodle" (itself a portmanteau of Labrador Retriever and a Poodle).
     Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually preceded the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the 
     great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who crossed the two breeds in 1969. The cross can result in a healthier animal than both parent breeds, 
     but can also produce puppies who are susceptible to health problems from both parents.</p>

     <h2 class="header"><b>Characteristics</b></h2>
     <h3><i>Appearance</i></h3>
     <p>The appearance, sizes and coat of Goldendoodles can vary considerably according to their breeding generations and what type of Poodle parents they have.
         While most Goldendoodles share common traits, each Goldendoodle might have its own unique appearance and temperament. Goldendoodles' retriever parentage 
         makes their body long and muscular, and likely to have a deep chest and wide stance.</p> 

    <p>Here are some common appearance related characteristics...</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Round skulls</li>
        <li>Broad muzzles</li>
        <li>Heavily feathered tail</li>
        <li>Drop ears</li>
        <li>Oval-shaped eyes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Goldendoodle is a long-haired dog breed and their coat can vary considerably, there are three main coat types...</p> 
    <ol>
        <li>Straight</li>
        <li>Wavy</li>

    </ol>

   <p> Wavy coated Goldendoodles are a combination of the Poodle's curly coat and the Golden Retriever's straight coat. 
    Their coat is wavy, with loose, shaggy curls. This type of coat is the most common amongst Goldendoodles. Curly coated 
    Goldendoodles resemble the coat of a Poodle. Their coat is thick and curly. Goldendoodles' coats come in varying colors,
     with the most common colors being cream, red, black, gold, apricot, brown, or a combination (parti-colored). </p>

     <h3><i>Behavioral</i></h3>
     <p>Similar to most crossbreed dogs, Goldendoodles tend not to have the same predictable temperament or patterning aspects 
        that the constituent breeds have. Based on genetic theory, well-bred Goldendoodle should express behaviours intermediate to their parent breeds.
    
        In general, Goldendoodles tend to take on Golden Retrievers’ <b>friendly, affectionate, trustworthy</b> and <b>enthusiastic</b> nature; whilst also demonstrating 
        Poodles’ <b>eputable intelligence, sociability</b>and <b>trainability</b>. Goldendoodles predominantly exhibit high energy level, loyalty and playfulness;they are
        friendly with children and considered a good family pet. Because they are so friendly and loyal, however, they are prone to separation anxiety, especially as puppies.</p>
