            <p class="body_text">In most healthcare systems and across all fields of medicine, doctors have been found to have higher 
                rates of depression and anxiety in comparison to the general population and other professional groups.
                <br>
                <br>
                The work done by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers is often glamorized because of the financial stability
                 and rewarding pay which it produces. What many fail to consider is the mental stress which these positions produce and the 
                 emotional baggage which healthcare professionals are forced to carry. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Working in the medical field has historically been considered a high-stress profession. For decades, doctors have dealt 
                with higher depression and burnout. This mental health crisis healthcare workers are facing was amplified during the pandemic:

      <p class="body_text"> Health care workers are in the midst of  a severe mental health crisis. The graphic to the left
        includes information on the higher levels of poor mental health days, burnout, intent to change jobs, and being harassed at work in 2022 compared to 
        2018 that health care workers are reporting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been in the process of collecting data that depicts the reality of this crisis. 
        The video to the right discusses how the CDC has analyzed data from the General Social Survey Quality of Worklife Module (conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago) in effort to compare 
        self-reported mental health symptoms from health care workers between the years 2018 and 2022.</p>

           Though prior to the pandemic doctors faced immense stress and pressure, the COVID-19 epidemic only emphasized the strain and intensity of their work environment. In recent years the 
           corruption within the country medical system has been brought to attention, while great focus is placed on why this is negatively impacting the general public little consideration has been 
           taken on how doctors, PA's, nurses, and other hospital staff are being affected.</p>
